I apologised for all the mistakes that I made. This was one of the checklist items in my life where I wanted to build a website for you. Sadly I id not get chance . But don't worry , I will say good bye with it. <3(Old school syle)",

Not to yourself. I think of you when I achieve something. I don't miss you. I breathe trying to implement everything I have learned so far. Trying to become a person I alwaays wanted to be. I hope you have all the things that you wanted to try and grow into. :)",

Probably fried my brain doing that. I wanted to say that in a way we did choose each other. I read all of our conversations. I analyzed both of us this time. I want you to be happy. I don't know what equation we share anymore so giving you a piece of my heart. We did choose each other Ajinkya",
